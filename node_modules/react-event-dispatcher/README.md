## What does this library offer?
- **Minimal**: It is a tiny yet crucial library for creating React apps in a much more faster and safer way.
- **Pure Abstraction**: It is so abstract that it doesn't even depend on react module. That means you can use it in any script too.
- **Fully Documented**: The project is well documented and has comprehensive unit tests.

## How to install? ðŸ“¦
Since the package is in npm you can use the command below to add it to your project packages:

``` bash
npm i react-event-dispatcher
```

## How to use? ðŸš€
In your React file you have to import it in ES6 syntax:

``` js
import EventEmitter from 'react-event-dispatcher'
```

Now you have full access to the library. Cheers! Let's try it with a basic example:
``` js
const eventToDispatch = () => console.log('It really works ðŸ‘Œ')
EventDispatcher.dispatch('RandomComponent', eventToDispatch)
EventDispatcher.runOne('RandomComponent')
// You should see 'It really works ðŸ‘Œ' on your console.
```

## A Complete Example

``` js
// Written in Node
const EventDispatcherFactory = require('react-event-dispatcher')
const myDispatcher = EventDispatcherFactory.create('MyDispatcher')

class ParentComponent {
	constructor() {
		this.updateChildName = myDispatcher.getOne('$child')
	}
}

class ChildComponent {
	// Assume that this._name is private
	constructor() {
		this._name = '@ChildComponent'
		// In React you don't need to bind
		// Just create a method in Component with arrow 
		// function since it is already bound to this
		const updateName = function(name) {
			this._name = name
		}.bind(this)
		EventDispatcherFactory.use('MyDispatcher').dispatch('$child', updateName)
	}

	get name() {
		return this._name
	}
}

const childComponent = new ChildComponent()
const parentComponent = new ParentComponent()
parentComponent.updateChildName('@AwesomeComponent')
console.log({
	name: childComponent.name
})
```
``` bash
# output
{ name: '@AwesomeComponent' }
```

## Motivation and Architecture
### Motivation
I have been working on React quite lately. And one of the problems I had encountered a lot is event propagation between miscellaneous components. At some point it had been so cumbersome that I had to left some of the projects that I have been dedicated for. So I wrote this minimal yet efficient library for React.

### Architecture
Since version `1.8.0`, the main architecture has been changed drastically. The architecture schema is like below:
